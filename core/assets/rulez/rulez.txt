Gomoku is a round based board game played by two
players on a 15x15 Go borad.


1. The first player starts by placing
two black and one white stone.

2. The second player then selects
one of the three following options:

	- play as black,

	- play as white and place
	  another white stone,

	- or place two more stones,
	  one white and one black,
	  and let the first player choose the color.



Then, each player takes a turn and places their
stone.

The first player to have placed five stones in a
row wins the game.
