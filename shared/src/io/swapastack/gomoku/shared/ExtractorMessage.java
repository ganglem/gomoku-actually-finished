 * This class is used as a pseudo message.
 * If the server receives a message it is encoded as JSON.

 * The server parses the JSON string to this io.swapastack.gomoku.shared.ExtractorMessage object.
 * If the message received is valid, then there is a message type.
 * After the message type is extracted the JSON string gets parsed to the correct
 * message class object, e.g. HistoryPush.
